 
## 🧠 **Goal**

You want to dynamically **spawn a new WebSocket game server (Go process)** when a new player (or game session) starts. Each server:

* Runs as a **long-living container** (not stateless REST).
* Needs **its own port** (or WebSocket path) to maintain a persistent connection.

---

## 🎮 What You’re Doing Right Now

* You deploy a **replicated Deployment** (`replicas: 3`), where each Pod can host game sessions.
* You expose all Pods through a **Service** and **Ingress**, routing clients via path-based rules (`/ws/:id`).
* You use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** to **scale the number of Pods** based on CPU usage.

This is a good general scalable setup — but it doesn’t create a **new Pod per session**, and it doesn’t **assign new ports dynamically**.

---

## ✅ Works well for:

* Relay servers
* Shared session servers (e.g., 1 server = 10 players)

---

## ❌ Not great for:

* **"1 game = 1 Pod" architecture**
* Or when you need **per-game isolated ports/instances** for strict session separation

---

## 💡 Strategy You May Want Instead

### 1. **Use a Custom Controller or API Gateway**

You’ll need a system that:

* **Listens** when a player wants to start a new session
* **Spawns a new game server Pod** (via Kubernetes API)
* **Assigns a unique port or path** and returns the address to the client

You can build this as a **Node.js/Go API** that:

* Uses the Kubernetes Go or REST API to:

  * Create a new **Pod** (or Deployment) dynamically
  * Return its **IP\:Port** or WebSocket path to the client

### 2. **Use a Headless Service or NodePort**

If each game server needs its **own port**, you can:

* Use a **NodePort** to expose it directly (limited ports available)
* Or assign a **unique WebSocket path** via Ingress (better scalability)

### 3. **Clean-up after the game ends**

* Use a TTL controller or finalizer to **delete game Pods** when finished.

---

## 🔧 Tools that can help:

* **KEDA** (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling) — scale Pods based on events (e.g., Redis queue, API trigger)
* **Custom Operator (via Kubebuilder)** — advanced, for fully automating Pod lifecycle per game session
* **Sidecar service** to launch & manage Pods dynamically

## 🧪 TL;DR – How to spawn WS game server per player

| Step | What You Need                                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Player hits your central API: “start game”                                |
| 2    | API creates a new Pod (or Deployment) with a unique session ID            |
| 3    | API returns the WebSocket URL (e.g., `wss://your-domain.com/ws/game-123`) |
| 4    | Player connects and uses it for the full game                             |
| 5    | After game ends, the Pod is deleted or times out                          |

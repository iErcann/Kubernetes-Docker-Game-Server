 
### What you need:

* **Expose each game server Pod individually** (not load-balanced)
* Dynamically create/destroy game server Pods as players create/join games
* Connect clients directly to the right Pod's IP/port or stable DNS

---

### How to do that in Kubernetes?

#### 1. Use a **StatefulSet** or dynamically created Pods with **stable network identity**

* StatefulSets give each Pod a stable hostname like:

  ```
  game-server-0.game-server.default.svc.cluster.local
  game-server-1.game-server.default.svc.cluster.local
  ```

* You can connect clients to these hostnames directly inside the cluster.

---

#### 2. Create **Headless Service**

* A headless service (`clusterIP: None`) allows DNS to resolve to the individual Pod IPs instead of a load-balanced IP.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: game-server
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: game-server
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
```

* This way, DNS returns multiple A records, one per Pod IP.

---

#### 3. Expose Pods externally individually

* If your VPS is the only node, you can create a **NodePort Service per Pod** or use **HostPort** in Pod spec:

```yaml
containers:
- name: game-server
  image: your-game-image
  ports:
  - containerPort: 8080
    hostPort: 31000  # Map this Pod's port 8080 to node port 31000
```

* With **hostPort**, each Pod listens on a different port on your VPS’s network interface.

---

#### 4. Dynamic Pod creation & routing

* Your backend can launch Pods **on demand** for each game session.
* Keep track of Pod IPs/hostPorts or DNS names.
* Clients connect directly to the specific Pod’s IP/port.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| StatefulSet + Headless svc | Stable DNS per Pod, no load balancing     | Easy DNS, individual pods         | Only internal cluster traffic  |
| HostPort in Pod spec       | Bind each Pod port to a unique VPS port   | Expose individual Pods externally | Need to manage port allocation |
| One NodePort per Pod svc   | One NodePort Service per Pod              | External access                   | Complex, ports may clash       |
| Service Mesh (e.g. Istio)  | Advanced routing for game session routing | Powerful routing                  | Complex setup                  |
